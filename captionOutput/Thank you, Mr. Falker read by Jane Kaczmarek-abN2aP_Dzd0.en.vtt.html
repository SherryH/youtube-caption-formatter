    <span class="caption"> Trisha, the littlest girl in the family, grew up loving books. Her schoolteacher mother read to her every night.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:01:32.760 </span>
    <span class="caption">Her redheaded brother brought his books home from school and shared them. And whenever she visited the family farm, her
      grandfather and grandmother read to her by the stone fireplace.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:01:44.380 </span>
    <span class="caption">When she turned five and went to kindergarten, most of all she hoped to read. Each day she saw the kids in the first
      grade across the hall reading, and before the year was over, some of the kids in her own class began to read. But not
      Trisha.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:01:58.560 </span>
    <span class="caption">Still, she loved being at school because she could draw. The other kids would crowd around her and watch her do her magic
      with the crayons. "In first grade, you'll learn to read," her brother said.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:02:20.079 </span>
    <span class="caption">In first grade, Trisha sat in a circle with the other kids. They were all holding Our Neighborhood, their first reader,
      sounding out letters and words.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:02:28.280 </span>
    <span class="caption">They said, "Buh- buh- buh- oy, boy, and luh- luh- ook, look." The teacher smiled at them when they put all the sounds
      together and got a word right. But when Trisha looked at a page, all she saw were wiggling shapes, and when she tried
      to sound out words, the other kids laughed at her.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:02:47.980 </span>
    <span class="caption">"Trisha, what are you looking at in that book?" they'd say. "I'm reading!" she'd say back to them.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:03:01.319 </span>
    <span class="caption">But her teacher would move on to the next person. Always when it was her turn to read, her teacher had to help her with
      every single word. And while the other kids moved up into the second reader and third reader, she stayed alone in Our
      Neighborhood.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:03:14.379 </span>
    <span class="caption">Trisha began to feel "different." She began to feel dumb. The harder words got for the little girl, the more and more
      time she spent drawing--</span>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:05:21.629 </span>
    <span class="caption">School seemed harder and harder now. Reading was just plain torture. When Sue Ellyn read her page, or Tommy Bob read
      his page,</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:05:30.780 </span>
    <span class="caption">they read so easily that Trisha would watch the top of their heads to see if something was happening to their heads that
      wasn't happening to hers. And numbers were the hardest thing of all to read. She never added anything right.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:05:43.939 </span>
    <span class="caption">"Line the numbers up before you add them," the teacher would say. But when Trisha tried, the numbers looked like a stack
      of blocks, wobbly and ready to fall.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:05:54.300 </span>
    <span class="caption">She just knew she was dumb. </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:06:44.110 </span>
    <span class="caption">And when her teacher read along with them, and called on Trisha for an answer, she gave the wrong answer every time.
      "Hey, dummy!" a boy called out to her on the playground, "How come you're so dumb?" Other kids stood near him and they
      laughed.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:07:01.930 </span>
    <span class="caption">Trisha could feel the tears burning in her eyes. How she longed to go back to her grandparents' farm in Michigan. Now
      Trisha wanted to go to school less and less. "I have a sore throat," she'd say to her mother. Or, "I have a stomachache."</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:07:18.889 </span>
    <span class="caption">She dreamed more and more, and drew more and more, and she hated, hated, hated school. Then, when Trisha started fifth
      grade, the school was all abuzz. There was a new teacher. He was tall and elegant.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:07:36.900 </span>
    <span class="caption">Everybody loved his striped coat and slick gray pants-- he wore the neatest clothes. All the usual teacher's pets gathered
      around him-- Stevie Joe and Alice Marie, Davy and Michael Lee.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:07:50.520 </span>
    <span class="caption">But right from the start, it didn't seem to matter to Mr. Falker which kids were the cutest. Or the smartest. Or the
      best at anything. Mr. Falker would stand behind Trisha whenever she was drawing, and whisper, "This is brilliant...
      absolutely brilliant. Do you know how talented you are?"</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:08:14.740 </span>
    <span class="caption">When he said this, even the kids who teased her would turn around in their seats and look at her drawings. But they still
      laughed whenever she gave a wrong answer.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:08:24.779 </span>
    <span class="caption">Then, one day, she had to stand up and read, which she hated. She was stumbling through a page in Charlotte's Web, and
      the page was going all fuzzy, when the kids began to laugh out loud.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:08:36.420 </span>
    <span class="caption">Mr. Falker, in his plaid jacket and his butterfly tie, said, "Stop! Are all of you so perfect that you can look at another
      person and find fault with her?" That was the last day anybody laughed out loud. Or made fun of her. All except Eric.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:08:57.500 </span>
    <span class="caption">He had sat behind Trisha for two whole years, but he seemed almost to hate her. Trisha didn't know why. He waited by
      the door of the classroom for her and pulled her hair. He waited for her on the playground, leaned in her face, and
      called her, "Toad!"</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:09:15.090 </span>
    <span class="caption">Trisha was afraid to turn any corner, for fear Eric would be there. She felt completely alone. The only time she was
      really happy was when she was around Mr. Falker. He let her erase the blackboards-- only the best students got to do
      that.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:09:30.070 </span>
    <span class="caption">He patted her on the back whenever she got something right, and he looked hard and mean at any kid who teased her. </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:09:43.750 </span>
    <span class="caption">The other kids wait for her on the playground, or in the cafeteria, or even in the bathroom, and to jump out and call
      her "Stupid" or "Ugly!" And Trisha began to believe them.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:09:58.710 </span>
    <span class="caption">She discovered that if she asked to go to the bathroom just before recess, she could hide under the inside stairwell
      during the free time, and not have to go outside at all. In that dark place she felt completely safe.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:10:14.410 </span>
    <span class="caption">But one day at recess, Eric followed her to her secret hiding place. "Have you become a mole?" he laughed. And he pulled
      her out into the hall, and danced around her. "Dumbell, dumbell, magotty old dumbell!</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:10:27.390 </span>
    <span class="caption">Trisha buried her head in her arms and curled up in a ball. Suddenly, she heard footsteps. It was Mr. Falker. He marched
      Eric down to the office. When he came back, he found Trisha. "I don't think you'll have to worry about that boy again,"
      he said softly.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:10:46.860 </span>
    <span class="caption">"What was he teasing you about, little one?" "I don't know." Trisha shrugged.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:10:54.950 </span>
    <span class="caption">Trisha was sure Mr. Falker believed that she could read. She had learned to memorize what the kid next to her was reading.
      Or she would wait for Mr. Falker to help her with a sentence, then she'd say the same thing that he did. "Good," he
      would say.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:11:11.680 </span>
    <span class="caption">Then, one day Mr. Falker asked her to stay after school and help wash the blackboards. He put on music and brought out
      little sandwiches as they worked and talked. All at once he said, "Let's play a game! I'll shout out letters. You write
      them on the board with the wet sponge as quickly as you can."</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:11:33.720 </span>
    <span class="caption">"A," he shouted. She wiped a watery A. "Eight," he shouted. She made a watery 8.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:11:42.370 </span>
    <span class="caption">"Fourteen... Three... D... M... Q," he shouted out. He shouted out many, many letters and numbers. Then he walked up
      behind her, and together they looked at the board. It was a watery mess. Trisha knew that none of the letters or numbers
      looked like they should.</span>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:11:55.560 </span>
    <span class="caption">She threw the sponge down and tried to run. But Mr. Falker caught her arm and sank to his knees in front of her.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:12:06.460 </span>
    <span class="caption">"You poor baby," he said. "You think you're dumb, don't you? How awful for you to be so lonely and afraid." She sobbed.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:12:21.000 </span>
    <span class="caption">"But, little one, don't you understand, you don't see letters or numbers the way other people do. And you've gotten through
      school all this time, and fooled many, many good teachers!" He smiled at her.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:12:29.070 </span>
    <span class="caption">"That took cunning, and smartness, and such, such bravery." Then he stood up and finished washing the board. "We're going
      to change all that, girl. You're going to read-- I promise you that."</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:12:44.030 </span>
    <span class="caption">Now, almost every day after school, she met with Mr. Falker and Miss Plessy, a reading teacher. They did a lot of things
      she didn't even understand!</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:13:01.800 </span>
    <span class="caption">At first she made circles in sand, and then big sponge letters on the blackboard, going from left to right, left to right.
      Another day they flicked letters on a screen, and Trisha shouted them out loud.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:13:13.750 </span>
    <span class="caption">Still other days she worked with wooden blocks and built words. Letters, letters, letters. Words, words, words. Always
      sounding them out. And that felt good. But though she'd read words, she hadn't read a whole sentence. And deep down
      she still felt dumb.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:13:32.420 </span>
    <span class="caption">And then one spring day-- had it been three months or four months since they had started?-- Mr. Falker put a book in
      front of her. She'd never seen it before. He picked a paragraph in the middle of a page and pointed at it.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:13:52.910 </span>
    <span class="caption">Almost as if it were magic, or as if light poured into her brain, the words and sentences started to take shape on the
      page as they never had before. "She... marched... them... off... to..." </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:14:11.160 </span>
    <span class="caption">Slowly, she read a sentence. Then another, and another. And finally she'd read a paragraph. And she understood the whole
      thing.
    </span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:14:29.140 </span>
    <span class="caption">She didn't notice that Mr. Falker and Miss Plessy had tears in their eyes. That night, Trisha ran home without stopping
      to catch her breath.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:15:33.890 </span>
    <span class="caption">Now that's the end of the story, but it's not the end of the book. The author has a little surprise for us. Listen...
      The rest of the year became an odyssey of discovery and adventure for the little girl. She learned to love school.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:15:49.780 </span>
    <span class="caption">I know because that little girl was me, Patricia Polacco. I saw Mr. Falker again some thirty years later at a wedding.
      I walked up to him and introduced myself.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <span class="time">00:16:03.100 </span>
    <span class="caption">At first he had difficulty placing me. Then I told him who I was, and how he had changed my life so many years ago. He
      hugged me and asked me what I did for a living. "Why, Mr. Falker," I answered. "I make books for children. Thank you,
      Mr. Falker. Thank you."</span>
